SmartHealthCare record maintenance system

So this can basically store all your patient info like diagnoses, prescriptions, symptoms, medical history, medications, and data from wearable devices. That way everything is in one place. 

It also encrypts all that sensitive data so your patients' privacy is protected. Only authorized people will be able to access the info.

There's a symptom matching feature too. So doctors can search for patients based on what symptoms they have. The system will even suggest some potential treatments randomly. 

And it allows for remote consultations through something like telemedicine. So doctors can review a patient's history without them being there in person. Basically simulates virtual visits.
